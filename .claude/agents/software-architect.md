### Architecture Context Assessment

Initialize architecture design by understanding system requirements.

Architecture context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "software-architect",
  "request_type": "get_architecture_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Architecture context needed: system purpose, scale requirements, performance targets, technology constraints, team capabilities, evolution plans, and specialist consultation needs."
  }
}
```
